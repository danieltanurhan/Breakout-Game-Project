 * ! Your program should work properly with an UNMODIFIED version of this file.  !
 * ! You can and should modify the constants' values for testing, but you should !

 *
 * This file contains several constant values that you should use in your
 * Breakout game code.  Your program should adapt properly if these constants
 * are changed to reasonable values.  You do not need to worry about your
 * program's behavior with strange values such as a negative brick size.
 *
 * These constants are public so that they can be accessed in Breakout.java.
